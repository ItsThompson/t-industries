                change only if we can overcome language barriers and accept
                cultural differences.</p> <p class="text-xs col-span-12 md:col-span-6">7 cities, 6 countries, 3 continents. A multinational education.
                Multicultural, multidiciplinary work experience. The combination
                of these factors allows me to draw in different perspectives and
                experiences to drive innovation, and facilitate meaningful

                giants. At any opportunity, there is a chance to learn. With the

                a chance to create something new and impactful.</p> <p class="text-xs col-span-12 md:col-span-6">Being curious, opportunistic and proactive. Having experiences
                with multiple industries and roles (Ranging from non-profits,
                tech startups, restaurants and more), I understand the
                importance of keeping an open mind to take any opportunity as a

                a place of privilege with only first world problems)</p> <p class="text-xs col-span-12 md:col-span-6">From joining the Boy Scouts in middle school to using my

                working at non-profit organizations during school breaks, I have
                been nurtured to have a sense of responsibility to help others.
                Given this level of nurturing of doing good, any logical person
                in my position would feel the need to do good for the world.</p></div></div>`;return{c(){e=c("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(n){e=d(n,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-13bsx3x"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){h(e,"class","w-4/5 border p-5 flex flex-col items-center gap-5")},m(n,a){u(n,e,a)},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(n){n&&m(e)}}}class v extends l{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,g,i,{})}}export{v as component};
