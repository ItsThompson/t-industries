            The diversity of the world population drives innovation and change
            only if we can overcome language barriers and accept cultural
            differences.

            7 cities, 6 countries, 3 continents. A multinational education.
            Multicultural, multidiciplinary work experience. The combination of
            these factors allows me to draw in different perspectives and
            experiences to drive innovation, and facilitate meaningful change.

            Innovation is accelerated by standing on the shoulders of giants. At
            any opportunity, there is a chance to learn. With the unique
            aggregate of personal knowledge and experiences, there is a chance
            to create something new and impactful.

            multiple industries and roles (Ranging from non-profits, tech

            keeping an open mind to take any opportunity as a chance to learn.

            From joining the Boy Scouts in middle school to using my programming
            skills to help local services in highschool to working at non-profit
            organizations during school breaks, I have been nurtured to have a
            sense of responsibility to help others. Given this level of
            nurturing of doing good, any logical person in my position would
            feel the need to do good for the world.
